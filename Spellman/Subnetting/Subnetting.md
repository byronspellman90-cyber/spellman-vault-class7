Absolutely! Here‚Äôs a **detailed mind map for the topic: ‚ÄúCreating My Own Subnets‚Äù**, structured with **main branches**, **sub-branches**, and **key concepts/ideas**, tailored for **beginners and intermediate learners**.

 üåê **Creating My Own Subnets ‚Äì Mind Map**


### 1. **Understanding Subnetting**

- **Definition**
    
    - Dividing a larger network into smaller, manageable subnetworks
        
- **Why Subnet?**
    
    - Improve network performance
        
    - Enhance security
        
    - Efficient IP address allocation
        
    - Simplify management

### 2. **IP Addressing Fundamentals**

- **IPv4 Basics**
    
    - 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
        
    - Classes: A, B, C, D, E
        
- **Private vs Public IPs**
    
    - Private: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16
        
- **CIDR Notation**
    
    - Classless Inter-Domain Routing (e.g., /24)
        

---

### 3. **Subnetting Concepts**

- **Subnet Mask**
    
    - Defines the boundary between network and host (e.g., 255.255.255.0)
        
- **Borrowing Bits**
    
    - From host portion to create more subnets
        
- **Formulae**
    
    - Number of Subnets = 2^n
        
    - Number of Hosts = 2^h ‚Äì 2
        
        - _n_: bits borrowed
            
        - _h_: bits remaining for hosts
            

---

### 4. **Subnet Design Process**

- **1. Identify Requirements**
    
    - Number of subnets
        
    - Number of hosts per subnet
        
- **2. Choose IP Range**
    
    - Use private IP block (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
        
- **3. Calculate Subnets**
    
    - Determine new subnet mask
        
    - Calculate increment for each subnet
        
- **4. Assign Ranges**
    
    - Network address
        
    - First & last usable IP
        
    - Broadcast address
        

---

### 5. **Practical Examples**

- **Example 1: Subnetting 192.168.1.0/24**
    
    - Goal: 4 subnets
        
    - Borrow 2 bits ‚Üí /26
        
    - Subnet ranges:
        
        - 192.168.1.0/26 ‚Üí 192.168.1.0 - 63
            
        - 192.168.1.64/26 ‚Üí 192.168.1.64 - 127
            
        - etc.
            
- **Example 2: Subnetting for 30 hosts**
    
    - Use /27 ‚Üí 32 IPs, 30 usable

### 6. **Tools for Subnetting**

- **Manual Calculation**
    
    - Subnetting charts
        
    - Binary math
        
- **Subnet Calculators**
    
    - Online tools (e.g., subnet-calculator.com)
        
- **CIDR Tables**
    
    - Quick reference for mask vs host counts
        

---

### 7. **Subnetting in Practice**

- **Home Networks**
    
    - Divide networks for IoT, guests, work devices
        
- **Enterprise Networks**
    
    - Separate departments (HR, IT, Finance)
        
    - VLAN integration
        
- **Cloud Networks**
    
    - VPC subnetting in AWS, Azure, GCP
        

---

### 8. **Advanced Subnetting Topics**

- **Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)**
    
    - Different mask lengths in same network
        
    - Efficient IP usage
        
- **Route Summarization**
    
    - Aggregating routes to reduce table size
        
- **Supernetting**
    
    - Merging multiple subnets into larger one
        
- **IPv6 Subnetting**
    
    - 128-bit addressing
        
    - /64 subnets standard
        

---

### 9. **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- **Overlapping Subnets**
    
- **Too Few Host Addresses**
    
- **Incorrect Broadcast Address**
    
- **Not Accounting for Future Growth**
    

---

### 10. **Best Practices**

- **Plan Before You Subnet**
    
- **Document Subnet Assignments**
    
- **Use Naming Conventions**
    
- **Segment by Function or Department**
    
- **Monitor IP Usage**
