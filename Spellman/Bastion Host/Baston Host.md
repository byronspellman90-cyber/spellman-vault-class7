A bastion host in AWS, also known as a jump server, is a secure entry point for administrators to access private EC2 instances within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that are not directly exposed to the internet.

Sure! Here’s a simple, **non-technical explanation** of what a **bastion host** is in AWS:

### 🛡️ **Bastion Host in AWS — In Layman’s Terms**

Imagine your AWS setup is like a **secure castle** with lots of rooms (servers). You don’t want just anyone walking in, right?

So instead of giving everyone direct keys to the rooms, you:

1. **Lock all the doors** to your castle (your servers are private and secure).
2. But… you need a way **for trusted people (like admins)** to get in when needed.

That's where a **bastion host** comes in.

### 🧑‍✈️ Think of it like a Guarded Gate

A **bastion host** is like a **guarded front gate** to your castle:

* It's the **only way in**.
* It's **heavily monitored and secured**.
* Only trusted people (admins) are allowed through it.
* Once inside, they can move around to other rooms (servers), but no one else can just come in directly.

### 🔒 Why use a Bastion Host?

* **Security**: Keeps your real servers private and protected.
* **Control**: You know exactly who is accessing your servers.
* **Auditing**: You can log and monitor access.

### In AWS terms:

* It’s usually just **one EC2 instance**.
* It sits in the **public subnet**.
* Other servers are in a **private subnet** (no direct internet access).
* You **SSH** into the bastion host, and from there, into your private servers.
